## Example Calculation 🔢  

**Input:**  
- Current CGPA: `3.50`  
- Completed Credits: `90`  
- 3 new courses with the following GPA and Credit:  
  - Course 1: GPA `4.0`, Credit `3`  
  - Course 2: GPA `3.7`, Credit `2`  
  - Course 3: GPA `3.0`, Credit `4`  

**Calculation:**  
1. **Total Points from Previous Credits:**  
   \[
   3.50 \times 90 = 315
   \]
2. **Points from Current Semester:**  
   \[
   (4.0 \times 3) + (3.7 \times 2) + (3.0 \times 4) = 12 + 7.4 + 12 = 31.4
   \]
3. **Total Credits:**  
   \[
   90 + 9 = 99
   \]
4. **New CGPA:**  
   \[
   \text{New CGPA} = \frac{315 + 31.4}{99} = 3.50
   \]
